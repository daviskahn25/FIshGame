# FIshGame

This is my first CS game. Its a water scene with Fish1 (blue fish) and Fish2 (orange fish) bouncing around the screen. Fishfood pops up on the screen
and when eaten that fish gets bigger, the fishfood then pops up somewhere else after a pause. Another bigger actions is that the image changes depending 
on which was that fish is swimming which I thought was pretty cool.
